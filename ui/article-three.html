			As per my experience till now this course is very interactive and interesting. It has been fun to learn new things here. The way Tanmai explains the practical modules is really cool. All the concepts explained by Dr. Gaurav Raina are really concise yet complete and very easy to understand. The learning curve set by the course designers and instructors is very comfortable. I am sure at the end of this course I will have better understanding of not only web applications but also many concepts of computer science.
